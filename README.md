# Deflect

## Purpose

[Distributed Denial of
Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Distributed_attack)
(DDoS) has become a cheap and common way to shut down legitimate voices. Deflect
tries to tilt the balance back in favour of freedom of expression.

This repository contains [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) playbooks to setup
and maintain your own DDoS mitigation infrastructure. Its implementation is
based on the [Deflect](https://deflect.ca) service run by
[eQualit.ie](https://equalit.ie), which protects hundreds of civil society web
sites and has thwarted [numerous
attacks](https://equalit.ie/deflect-labs-reporting/).

Deflect aims at making it easier to set up an infrastructure capable to absorb
large volumes of HTTP traffic without having to subscribe to expensive
commercial services or buy specialised infrastructure. It also allows you to
keep control of your data and therefore respect visitors' privacy.

## Who is it for?

Civil society organisations wanting to defend their and their partners' web
sites at reasonable cost, with trustworthy software and while safeguarding
privacy. Many organisations have emphasised the importance not to sacrifice
privacy for DDoS protection. By running your own Deflect, there will be no
third-party middleman to your web traffic.

Deflect integrates a user-friendly web-based dashboard for both users and system
administrators. It therefore makes it easier to set up a commercial,
user-oriented DDoS protection service.
